**Course 1:** [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning)

This course teaches the basic structure and function artificial neural networks. 
We start with some background on deep learning, then go on to build a logistic regression unit as a single neuron of a neural network using [Numpy]().
Next we line-up a number of these neurons into a shallow single layered neural network. 
Then finally we stack multiple layers to build a completed deep neural network.
